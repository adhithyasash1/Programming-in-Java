Employee e1 does a set of projects. Employee e2 also does all the projects did by e1
except the first project, in place of which e2 does another project. Write a program that
defines two classes Employee and Test. Define copy constructor to create e2 from el in
such a way that changing the values of instance variables of either e2 or e1 should not
affect the other one. The code takes name of e2 and new project done by e2 as input.
Complete the program as specified below.
