Employee e1 does a set of projects.
Employee e2 also does all the projects done by e1 except the first project,
in place of which e2 does another project.

Write a program that defines two classes Employee and Main.

Create copy of e1, say it as e2 in such a way that
changing the values of instance variables of either e2 or e1
should not affect the other one.

The code takes the name of e2 and new project done by e2 as input.

Complete the program as specified below :

    Class Employee that implements Cloneable interface and has the following members.
        - Private instance variables String name and
          String[] projects to store name and projects respectively
        - Define required constructor
        - Define accessor methods getName( ) and getProject( )
        - to get name of employee and project at specific index.
        - Define mutator methods setName( ) and setProject( )
          to set name of employee and project at specific index.
        - Define the method clone( )

    Class Main that has the method main which does the following.
        - Two objects of Employee e1 and e2 are created.
          e2 is created using e1.clone()

          Input to update name of e2 and second item
          bought by e2 are taken
