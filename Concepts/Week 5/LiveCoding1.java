/*
Write a program that, given two integers, two doubles as x and y coordinates of two
points p1 (x1, y1) and p2(x2, y2) on a two-dimensional plane as input, finds the mid-
point p3 (x3, y3) of the line segment formed by p1 and p2 using the formula :

x3 = (x1 + x2) / 2 	; 	y3 = (y1 + y2) / 2

Generic class Point has the following members :

-> 	Instance variables x and y
-> 	A constructor to initialize x and y
-> 	A method mid (Point p) to return the mid-point of the line segment joining the
	current point to p
-> 	A method that overrides the method toString () in the Object class to format the
	output

Class Test has the main method : 
->	The main method accepts the two input points. The first line of input will be two
	integers of point p1. The second line of input will be two doubles of point p2. It
	then invokes the method mid of one of the objects.
