/*
Write a Java code that takes as input a positive number (length of an array here),
and two arrays of that length - one of integers and another of strings.
The code must also take an integer and a String as input, and
print the number of occurrences of the integer and
the string in the integer array and the string array, respectively.

Format of input :
Length of the arrays
-> Elements in the integer array (in separate lines)
-> Element to count in the integer array
-> Elements in the string array (in separate lines)
-> Element to count in the string array

Variables used in the code :
-> len - represents length of array
-> s1 - represents an element to be counted for in Integer array
-> s2 - represents an element to be counted for in String array

    // To Define method display() that print the elements of array a
    // Define method elementCount(T x) that
    // counts the no. of times x is present in the array a
