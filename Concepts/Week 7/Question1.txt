Write a Java program that takes as input 4 Customer objects and
the list of Customer objects with attributes customer name, and expense.

The program computes the discount amount payable to each customer
(assuming discount rate is 5% of the expense value, and
is applicable for all customers having expense value >= 1000) and
prints the discount amount in the format given in sample input-output.

For customers who are not eligible for discount,
it prints "Non-Discountable Expense".

Complete the program as specified below:
  • Define a checked exception (extends Exception) DiscountException that returns
    the string "Non-Discountable Expense" if getMessage() method of DiscountException is called.

  • Define class Customer, which should have the following members:
    – Instance variables – name and expense
    – final variable – DiscountRate is 0.05
    – a suitable constructor to initialize the instance variables
    – accessors getName() to obtain the value of name
    – method checkDiscount() that computes the discount amount if the expense  is >= 1000;
      otherwise, throws DiscountException.

  • Class ExceptionTest has the main method and the method displayCustomers.
    - In method displayCustomers, invokes the checkDiscount() on each customer object.
