Effectively I am postposning the choice of instantiation
instead of committing right at the beginning of what 
type of implementation i will be using for a block of code 

	Main Advantage being, we do not need to 
	restructure the whole code to implement a
	different data structure (reduce the amount 
	of code updates) 

Effective use of Interfaces to flexibly choose between various concrete implementations

Interfaces add a level of indirection

we first introduced interfaces partly, it looked like a reaction to the fact that
Java does not supply a support multiple inheritance. So, we said if you want to keep track of
multiple capabilities in a class, we allowed it to support these multiple abstract interfaces. But
interfaces actually have a much larger role to play in some sense in the context of object
oriented programming and object oriented thinking, they give you this level of indirection.
